Welcome to the Discord Webhook API Documentation!
===================================

**sdwhapidocs** This is an acronym for "Simple Discord WebHook API Docs"
This API Allows newbies in programming, to manage and interact with webhook without any problems.
For now this is a beta API, But in the future I want to finalize it and make it an API that all C# Unity beginners can use.
*I use my own API.*

.. note::

   REQUIREMENTS: Newtonsoft.Json for Unity.

.. warning::

   Like I said it's a beta API and beta Docs so please correct me, message me for problems, etc. Discord ID: 1026084150895202385
