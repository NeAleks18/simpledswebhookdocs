To use the API, you need an Asset Store:

.. note::

   Asset Store - Asset Store (Ready-made models, scripts, etc.) from Unity

Go to the link: https://sdwhapi.neserver.space/

.. warning::

   Go to the linkIf the link does not work it means either we have malfunctions or asset is not yet posted, in any case write to me.

Open the file with the extension .unitypackage and be happy (You must have a project open before opening it)

.. warning::

   Before using it, don't forget to visit the DiscordWebhookAPI.cs file because you need to change the ID and TOKEN there

How to get ID and TOKEN?
Let's take a look at the link that discord gives us when copying a webhook link.
